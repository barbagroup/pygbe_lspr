# PyGBe on Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)

This folder contains three Jupyter notebooks, reporting on preliminary results with PyGBe-LSPR.
They include code verification of PyGBe's new LSPR feature using analytical solutions, and grid-convergence analysis.

The three notebooks contain:

1. An introduction, giving an overview of PyGBE and LSPR computations of the scattered electromagnetic field on a detector.
2. Results for an isolated nanoparticle, computing the extinction cross-section as a function of wevelength for silver 
and gold spheres in water, and comparing with the analytical solution.
3. LSPR sensor response calculation for one spherical nanoparticle surrounded by six spherical "molecules,"
and grid-convergence study (using Richardson extrapolation).
